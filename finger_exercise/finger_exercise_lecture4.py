# Assume you are given a positive integer variable named N. Write a piece of Python code that finds the cube root of N. 
# The code prints the cube root if N is a perfect cube or it prints error if N is not a perfect cube.
# Hint: use a loop that increments a counterâ€”you decide when the counter should stop.

N = 27
counter = 0
cube_counter = 0
while counter**3 < N:
    counter +=1
    if counter**3 == N:
        print(f"{counter**3} is a perfect Cube")
        break
    else:
        print("Error")
