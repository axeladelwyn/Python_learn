"""
Question 1: Simplify n*n + log(n) + 2**a to determine θ in terms of n.                  
its 2**n because its growing the fastest when the input is really big
Question 2: Simplify 2**n + n*log(n) + n**2 to determine θ in terms of n
2**n is big Theta.                  
Question 3: Simplify f*log(f) + 100000 + 300*a + x*y*z to determine θ in terms of n.
x*y*z big theta"""
