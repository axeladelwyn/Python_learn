    The most frequent word:

          freqencies as the combined word frequency.
        * need not be in both dictionaries, i.e it can be exclusively in
          dict1, dict2, or shared by dict1 and dict2.
    If multiple words are tied (i.e. share the same highest frequency),
    return an alphabetically ordered list of all these words.

### Problem 5: Finding TF-IDF ###
def get_tf(file_path):

           a sorted list of tuples (in increasing TF-IDF score), where each tuple is
           of the form (word, TF-IDF). In case of words with the same TF-IDF, the
           words should be sorted in increasing alphabetical order.
